Front end for my job board website

##  This is a work in progress

This is a work in progress django app. 
At it's finalization it will have a frontend react part and the backend django part in which I am working at this moment. This app is a job board for blue collar jobs. My father is a hard working fireman, who has worked hard to raise 1 son (me) and my 2 sisters. Even today, he gives a hand to his children and give powerful advice every now and then. This is a living tribute to him. It is done with love and I expect to deploy it on heroku or google cloud soon as a personal project. 

### Expected features

- Browse blue collar jobs as a candidate and apply to them
- An user model and 2 submodels candidate and company (employer or jobposter)
- Post jobs as an employer
- Register as an employer or as a job candidate, or both
- Upload your cv
- Send your preffered cv to the company that holds the job post
- Search, order and filter jobs
- Jobpost pagination
- An employer qualification and review system, where former employers can post their reviews anonymously, and they can give tips too, like what to expect, how to fit better on the position, the company culture etc.
- These reviews in the future could be posted in companies not registered with us, another db schema of non registered companies could be added too.
